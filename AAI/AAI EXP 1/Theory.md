# Experiment: Design and Implementation of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Outcome Prediction

---

## Aim

To design and implement a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using Python for modeling sequential data and predicting the next hidden state based on observed outcomes.

## Theory

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a probabilistic model used to represent systems that evolve over time and where the underlying states of the system are not directly observable. Instead, the system produces a sequence of observable outputs that are probabilistically related to these hidden states. HMMs are widely used for sequence modeling and outcome prediction in applications such as speech recognition, bioinformatics, activity recognition, and time-series analysis.

An HMM consists of the following key components:

1. **Hidden States**  
   These represent the internal states of the system that cannot be directly observed. In this experiment, the hidden states represent the latent conditions that generate the observed sequence.

2. **Observations**  
   Observations are the visible outputs generated by the hidden states. In this implementation, the observations are discrete symbols, making the Multinomial Hidden Markov Model suitable for modeling the data.

3. **Initial State Probability**  
   This defines the probability of the system starting in each hidden state. It is represented as a probability vector that sums to one.

4. **State Transition Probability Matrix**  
   This matrix defines the probability of transitioning from one hidden state to another. It captures the temporal dependency between states and is used to predict future states of the system.

5. **Emission Probability Matrix**  
   This matrix defines the probability of observing a particular output given a hidden state. It links the hidden states to the observed sequence.

Mathematically, an HMM is defined by the parameter set λ = (A, B, π), where:

- π is the initial state probability vector  
- A is the state transition probability matrix  
- B is the emission probability matrix  

The model is trained using the **Baum–Welch algorithm**, a special case of the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm. During training, the algorithm iteratively estimates the transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and initial state probabilities that maximize the likelihood of the observed sequence.

In this experiment, a **MultinomialHMM** is used because the observations are discrete. After training, the **Viterbi algorithm** is applied to determine the most probable sequence of hidden states corresponding to the observed data. Based on the last predicted hidden state, the transition probability matrix is used to estimate the most likely next hidden state, enabling outcome prediction.

## Conclusion

In this experiment, a Hidden Markov Model was successfully implemented to analyze sequential data and predict future outcomes. The model effectively learned the hidden state transitions and emission patterns from the observed sequence. By using the transition probability matrix, the next hidden state was predicted based on the current state. The results demonstrate that Hidden Markov Models are powerful tools for modeling temporal dependencies and outcome prediction in sequential data.
